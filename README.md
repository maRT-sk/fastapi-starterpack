## Overview

**FastAPI StarterPack** is a foundation for building async full-stack web applications.
Engineered to simplify development, it offers a robust and organized starting point for your projects, which can be
tailored to specific needs.

### Technology Stack

- **FastAPI/Starlette**: High-performance asynchronous web framework.
- **Jinja2**: Server-side templating engine.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for modern UI design.
- **Alpine.js**: JavaScript framework for composing behavior directly in your markup.
- **HTMX.js**:  JavaScript framework that simplifies AJAX and dynamic content updates.
- **PostgreSQL or SQLite**: Databases integrated with SQLAlchemy  for ORM and query management.
- **Alembic**: Database migration management.
- **UV**: An extremely fast Python package and project manager.
- **MyPy and Ruff**: Ensures static type checking, linting, and code formatting.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Python >=3.12**
- **[uv >=0.5.9](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)**: Package and project manager.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maRT-sk/fastapi-starterpack.git
cd fastapi-starterpack
```

### Install Dependencies

Synchronize and install the required dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Start the Application

1. Create a .env file in the project root directory. Use .env.template as a reference for required variables.

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```

The server will run on port 8000 with hot-reload enabled for real-time updates.

### Database Setup

This project supports PostgreSQL and SQLite as database backends, providing flexibility for different use cases.
Dependencies can be simplified based on the chosen backend:

- For PostgreSQL, feel free to remove SQLite-related packages with `uv remove aiosqlite`.
- For SQLite, feel free to remove PostgreSQL-related packages with `uv remove psycopg2`.

#### For PostgreSQL:

1. Create and start a Docker container for PostgreSQL:

    ```bash
    task db-create
    ```

2. Create and apply migrations:

    ```bash
    task alembic-up
    ```

3. Enter a migration message when prompted (e.g., "initial").  
   Review the generated migration file in `alembic/versions`, and confirm with "Y" to apply the upgrade.

#### For SQLite:

- Similar to PostgreSQL, but **skip `task db-create`**, as SQLite automatically creates the database file.   
  Simply create and apply migrations:

    ```bash
    task alembic-up
    ```

  Enter a migration message (e.g., "initial"), check generated file in `alembic/versions`, and confirm to apply the
  upgrade.

## Development Tools

### Tasks

To view the full list of available tasks, run the following command:

```bash
task list
```

Below is a list of the currently available tasks for project management and automation:

- **`alembic-up`**
  Creates an Alembic migration with a user-specified message and upgrades the database.

- **`db-create`**
  Creates and starts a Docker container for PostgreSQL with default credentials from .env file.

- **`db-remove`**
  Stops and removes the running PostgreSQL Docker container after confirmation.

- **`db-start`**
  Starts an existing PostgreSQL Docker container.

- **`generate-req`**
  Generates a `requirements.txt` file from `pyproject.toml`.

- **`tw-install`**
  Installs Tailwind CSS as a dependency and initializes its configuration file.

- **`tw-watch`**
  Watches the input CSS file and project files for changes and updates the output CSS file.

#### Usage Example

To run a task, use the following command:

```
task <task-name>
```

For example, to create a PostgreSQL container:

```
task db-create
```

### Linting and Formatting

Run linting checks:

```
uv run ruff check .
```

Fix linting issues automatically:

```
uv run ruff check . --fix
```

Format the code:

```
uv run ruff format
```

### Type Checking

Type-check the code with mypy:

```
uv run mypy .
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Execute all pre-commit hooks:

```
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Roadmap
